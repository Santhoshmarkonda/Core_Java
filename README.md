# Core Java Examples 🚀

This repository is a **practical guide to mastering Core Java** concepts.  
Each folder contains focused examples demonstrating how Java works in real-world scenarios — from basics like classes and objects to advanced features like multithreading and streams.

| `exceptionhandling`    | Try-catch, throws, custom exceptions, chained exceptions |
| `multithreading`       | Thread creation, lifecycle, synchronization, and executors |
| `streamapi`            | Java 8+ Streams with `filter`, `map`, `reduce`, and collectors |
| `filehandling`         | File reading/writing with I/O streams and serialization |
| `inheritance`          | Examples of inheritance, `super`, `this`, and method overriding |
| `interfaces`           | Interface examples, multiple inheritance through interfaces |
| `polymorphism`         | Compile-time (method overloading) and runtime (method overriding) polymorphism |

Would you like me to also **add a topic-wise learning roadmap section** (Day 1: Basics, Day 2: OOP, Day 3: Collections, etc.) so recruiters see it’s structured like a self-learning curriculum?
